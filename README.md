# âš“Puerto Madero UrubÃ³ Management Systemâš“
The Puerto Madero UrubÃ³ Management System is a comprehensive web application developed to streamline the operations and enhance the efficiency of Puerto Madero UrubÃ³, a prominent company specializing in housing projects. This system is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, EJS, and various other technologies.

## Features ðŸ”¥
### ðŸ“†Schedule Visit
The current version of the website offers a convenient "Schedule Visit" feature that allows anyone interested in the housing project to schedule a visit. Visitors can select their preferred date and time, providing them with flexibility and ensuring a smooth experience. The scheduled visits are stored and managed in a MongoDB database, enabling easy access to the details of each visit.

### Authentication and Authorization (Upcoming)
In the future, the website will incorporate a robust authentication system. This feature will provide secure access to different levels of users, including administrators and employees. By implementing authentication, only authorized personnel will be able to access sensitive information and perform administrative tasks.

### Access Control and Database Permissions (Upcoming)
The management system will grant different levels of access to the database based on user roles. Administrators will have complete control over the database, while employees will have limited access to specific functionalities. This ensures data integrity and privacy by restricting unauthorized modifications.

### Social Media Integration (Upcoming)
To enhance communication and engagement, the website will integrate social media features. This will include real-time chat functionality, allowing visitors, employees, and administrators to interact and address queries or concerns effectively. These features will foster a sense of community and provide a platform for seamless communication.
